# Day 11: Make a Mouse Jiggler


These 10 lines of CircuitPython code will enable a Raspberry Pi Pico to emulate a mouse, and move the mouse around the screen to convince our boss that we are working.

Copy code.py to the root of a Raspberry Pi Pico running CircuitPython.
Copy the lib folder as is to the same root. 
The mouse pointer will then start moving around the screen.
Unplug the Raspberry Pi Pico when you want to do some real work.

Obviously I don't take responsibility for you slacking off work. This is a bit of fun and not a career option. 

## Happy Hacking!
