# Day 7: A Davinci Resolve Shortcut Keyboard

![Running project](https://github.com/lesp/MakerAdvent2023/blob/main/Day%207%20-%20Shortcut%20Keyboard/day7.png?raw=true)

I don't like spending lots of money, so when I wanted a shortcut keyboard for DaVinci Resolve, I made one!

Using [Adafruit's fantastic guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/neokey-emoji-keyboard/overview) and 3D print files, I tweaked the code to produce a four-key keyboard with the common shortcuts that I use in DaVinci Resolve.

Here you can download my code and get everything working in moments, all you need are the following.
