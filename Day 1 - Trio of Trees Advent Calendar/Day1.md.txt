# Day 1: A Trio of Trees Advent Calendar

We kick off Maker Advent 2023 with Pocketmoneytronics' wonderful [Trio of Trees](https://pocketmoneytronics.co.uk/?page_id=33) for the Raspberry Pi Pico. For Â£10 this is a really cool little project to keep makers busy over the holidays.

So simple to build, and the included instruction book has just enough information to fire your imagination into building a cool project.

I used mine to create an advent calendar which uses NTP (Network Time Protocol) to get the current date and illuminate the corresponding LED on the tree. When I go past day 14, the LEDs for a certain number blink together. So 15 would see LEDs 1 and 5 blink, 21, 2 and 1 etc.

## Happy Hacking!
